About the project
In this project, I try to provide a simple boilerplate for anyone who wants to use Django as a backend, and offer jwt-auth based API.
Also, I implemented a simple notes app example using React (react-boilerplate). In case you have any questions about the code, please feel free to ask.



React Localhost : 127.0.0.1:3000

]Django localhost : 127.0.0.1:8000

We have used Material UI from https://material-ui.com/ and install some extra features to our react project for example Icones and Labs packages.

we have used Html forms and php for Login and Sign up forms.
