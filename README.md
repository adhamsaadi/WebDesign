About the Project

In this project, we provide a simple boilerplate for anyone who wants to use Django as a backend and offers a JWT-auth based API. We have also implemented a simple notes app example using React (react-boilerplate). If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to ask.

React Localhost: 127.0.0.1:3000
Django Localhost: 127.0.0.1:8000

We have used Material UI from https://material-ui.com/ and installed some extra features to our React project, such as Icons and Labs packages. We have also used HTML forms and PHP for login and sign-up forms.
